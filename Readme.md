Geometric Predicates
====================

This is a C++14 library which contains all the required base predicates for
developing computational geometry algorithms. The primary reason for developing this is
to have a unified framework that doesn't have any use GPL'esque dependencies. It will 
make it easy for me to publish the algorithms i develop for my graduate work.

More info will be added later once the library is fully developed and mature.

Note :
This doesn't essentially follow all the C++ guidelines by the book / use any complex
design patterns. Its primary purpose to have a simple framework which allows me to showcase
algorithms. Comments suggesting improvement in **"architecture"** or **"over-engineering"** will not
be entertained.
